      \begin{cvitems}
       \item Developed a search algorithm for cooperating UAVs to maximize area knowledge and the number of tracked targets 
       %using Gaussian process regressions 
%        \item Implemented a Gaussian Mixture Model-based Kalman filter for more accurate target tracking with heterogeneous sensors 
         \item Trained a model to classify ten gestures using accelerator and gyroscope measurements with an accuracy of 95\%
         \item Designed and tested intuitive behaviors and gestures for naturally directing UAV swarms
%        \item Presented the research at the ICUAS 2019 conference
%        \item Designed and trained a model to classify ten intuitive gestures for naturally directing the behavior of UAV swarms. Model used accelerator and gyroscope measurements to classify with 95\%.
%        \item Submitted article to the Journal of Intelligent \& Robotics Systems
